# REST API microservice in golang

## Why?

There are many open source boilerplate repos but why I did this ?

1. Coming from years of building Full Stack application in ReactJS and JVM based languages, I did not like any of them
   completely.
   So I created my own while obeying 'GO' principles and guidelines.
   You will find a lot of similarities in this repo when compared to the most popular go boilerplate templates because I
   probably borrowed ideas from them. (my apologies if I failed to miss any of them in the references)

2. I wanted to pick the tools for Routing, Logging, Configuration Management etc., to my liking and preferences.

3. I wanted a version where I have full control to change/update based on my professional work requirements.

### QuickStart

Pre-requisites:

- Docker Compose

1. Start the service

        make start

2. Visit Swagger API in browser

        open http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html

   If you are a fan of Postman, import the included [Postman collection](orders.postman_collection.json)

### QuickStart - Develop

Pre-requisites: Docker, Docker Compose, [Swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag), fswatch

1. Start the service in live reload mode

        make develop

2. Use postman to explore the existing APIs, start with SeedDB request.

Other Options:

Choose a command to run in go-rest-api-example:

      start                                      Starts everything that is required to serve the APIs
      develop                                    Starts API Server in live reload mode and starts the required supplementary services in the background
      run                                        Run the API server alone in normal mode (without supplemantary services such as DB etc.,)
      restart                                    Restarts the API server
      run-live                                   Run the API server with live reload support (requires fswatch)
      build                                      Build the API server binary
      docker-build                               Build the API server as a docker image
      docker-run                                 Run the API server as a docker container
      docker-start                               Builts Docker image and runs it.
      docker-stop                                Stops the docker container
      docker-remove                              Removes the docker images and containers   
      docker-clean                               Cleans all docker resources
      docker-clean-service-images                Stops and Removes the service images
      docker-clean-build-images                  Removes build images
      version                                    Display the current version of the API server
      api-docs                                   Generate OpenAPI3 Spec
      test                                       Run tests
      coverage                                   Measures code coverage and generates HTML report

### Tools

1. Routing - [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
2. Logging - [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog)
3. Configuration - [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
4. Database - [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/)
5. Container - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
6. API Spec Generation - [Swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag)

### Features

- Live reload while developing
- OpenApi3 Spec generation
- Easy to use 'make' tasks to do everything
- Multi-Stage container build (cache enabled)
- Versioning using git commit (both Application and Docker objects)
- Git Actions to build, security analysis and to run code coverage
- Templated Docker and Make files 

### TODO

- [ ] Add more and clear documentation about the features this offers and how to replace tools
- [ ] Automate Open API3 Spec Generation completely
- [ ] Add DB Migration Support
- [ ] Add more profiles and obey all [12-Factor App rules](https://12factor.net/ru/)
- [ ] Deploy to cloud
- [ ] Add missing references/inspirations
- [ ] Improvements to the api in terms of error handling, proper messaging etc., ( that wasn't focus)
- [ ] API Documentation - Lot of potential to improve
